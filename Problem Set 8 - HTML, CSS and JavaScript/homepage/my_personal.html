        <hr>
        <p>Outside of work and university, I enjoy doing many things, but the most important one for me is spending quality time with family and friends.</p>
        <p>As a kid, i spent most of my time at home playing video games, which actually brought me closer to the IT field. I still play some games today, but not nearly as much as before.<br>When i grew older, I started practicing different activities like <b>working out, running, and kitesurfing</b>. I’ve also thought about trying jiu-jitsu, but I haven’t started yet because of time constraints.</p>
        <p></p>

        <p>Another thing is that i enjoy so much sharing meals with my girlfriend. Every week, we try new recipes together, although we always end up going back to our favorite, <b>burgers</b>.</p>

        <p><mark>Extra information:</mark> We also had a vacation trip to chile a few months ago and we did not like the foods we tried there, by the way the country is amazing!</p>
