# HELP DAVID!
### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/CJVTGBxEjk8>
### Description:
The main idea behind this project wasn’t really to make something super useful or complex. I just wanted to have fun, try something new, and make something cool along the way.

This final project is a simple little game made with Pygame, where David needs your help to find his lost lecture items: the CS50 duck, the CS50 stress ball, and his computer. Without them, he can’t teach or hand out those classic CS50 gifts to his students!

Your goal in the game is to explore the map, collect all three items, and bring them back to David. Once you do that, you win!

The game is very easy to play. To control your player you must press A to move left, D to move right, W to move back and S to move front. The first thing you should do is approach on david and see what he is saying in the text bar and then going to search the things that he asked for. After walking through the map and once you find the objects you must press P to pick up them. With all the three objects in hands you should return back to david and when you get there, approach david and press G to give him the objects.

I made the entire map and most of the sprites myself. The creative process was based on old pokemon two dimensional maps, where the character could walk in four directions. I created the map in tilesets with the help of an old wacom intuos drawer and aseprite app that i bought 4 days ago(10/02/2025) just to create this project. It was really fun designing the environment and trying to give it a bit of personality and charm. And i also had to watch other lectures to finish the idea of this mini game and for a moment i thought to switch python language game to develop some webgame with HTML, CSS and JS. The only sprites I didn’t make from zero were the characters, i edited their hair to more like mine and David, and clothes that David wears based on a template sprite sheet. I got from a Drew Conley video on YouTube. I also got some inspiration from a project by Celina Emily Varchausky, which helped me shape the overall style I wanted. To finish here, the songs i used here i took from mario when it gets coins and the soundtrack is from one of my favorite games that is called Kingdom Hearts, the song is Traverse Town theme, but in 8 bit version, then its gonna match with the game aesthetic, and i took it from a youtube video called 'Traverse Town Theme in 8 bit'.

Overall, it’s a small, simple project, but it was a pleasure to make. I learned a lot about creativity, design, and how fun game development can be. A huge thanks to Harvard, to CS50 and mainly to David Mallan with his awsome teaching skills. Thank you so much!
