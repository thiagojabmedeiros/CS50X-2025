        <p>I graduated from a high school called Souza Leão. It was a time when I had plenty of opportunities to enjoy myself and do productive things, but, as I was just a typical teenager, I didn’t take advantage of it.</p>
        <p>Even so, when I was younger, I used to be very creative and even had my own YouTube channel. That was the first time I ever created something. I made animation videos, and the content was about my favorite characters from games, anime, or movies fighting each other in random universes where they met.<br>Here’s a link where you can watch them:<br><br><a class="button" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheIEmocrazY" target="blank">My first youtube channel!</a></p>

        <p>After high school, I went straight into the army. That was my first and most intense job experience. I joined as an inexperienced teenager with no real knowledge of the military, and by the end of the year, I was commanding a whole crew. There, I learned the true meaning of friendship, respect, leadership, and the limits of both body and mind. Honestly, it was the biggest challenge of my life so far.</p>

        <p>When my time in the army ended, I started preparing for university entrance exams. I studied for two years until I was accepted into UFRPE, where I am currently studying Computer Science.</p>
        <p>While preparing for the exams, I also had to work. As an adult with responsibilities, and a wonderful girlfriend, i needed an income to maintain the life I wanted for us. I currently work as a Sales Development Representative, which has been a great opportunity to improve my communication skills and learn how to deal with different kinds of people.</p>
